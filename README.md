# AMP--Parkinson-s-Disease-Progression-Prediction

The Main.ipynb part of the code will be updated every week 
and the other file which is a data pipeline is a class to process all the functions at once
which will get implemented further if there is any sucess in passing through it either way 
that file will be used in every machine learning code on this profile and be updated to automate 
and handle eventually all test cases.
